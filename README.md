## Hosting the resume on GitHub Pages
### Create a repository
  After creating an account, a repository is needed for storing the resume as well as the documentation (images, video, README.md file, etc. ) that come with it. It can be accomplished by doing the following steps:

1. Go to the main page -> click on the plus sign at the top right corner -> click on "New repository"

### Create a README file
  Creating the README file is important and it needs to be included right after you created the repository since
  the file acts as the front page of your repository (Everyone will look at your README file first before other things)
  . README file contains the information that allows the visitors to have an overview of your repository such as what the repository is about, how to get started, etc. You can create a readme file by doing following steps:

1. Go to the repository and click README

### Upload resume to the repository that just created
  It's time to upload the resume to the repository with the name "index.md". The reason behind the name is when adding the Jekyll theme afterwards, the theme will be applied to the index.md file only. Follow the steps below to upload the resume to the repository.
1. Go to the repository then click "Create new file"
